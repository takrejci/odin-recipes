This is an Odin Project assignment in the foundations course. I will be using HTML to create a basic recipe website.

The skills I hope to demonstrate are:
-basic HTML syntax
-website structuring and organization: proper file names, index.html, using relative links properly, etc.
-use of links, images, anchors, elements, and  tags.
-comfortablity and proper use of terminal commands
-ability to commit and write a good commit message
