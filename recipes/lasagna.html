        <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 16oz package lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 pound small-curd cottage cheese</li>
        <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 16oz package shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1: Gather all ingredients</li>
        <li>Step 2: Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes</li>
        <li>Step 3: Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes</li>
        <li>Step 4: Sitr in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reuce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes</li>
        <li>Step 5: While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside. While the noodles are cooking, preheat oven to 375.</li>
        <li>Step 6: Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt and pepper in a large bowl until combined</li>
        <li>Step 7: Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to coat it. Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover</li>
        <li>Step 8: Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil</li>
        <li>Step 9: Bake in the preheated oven for 30-40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Step 10: Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.</li>
        <li>Step 11: Enjoy!</li>
